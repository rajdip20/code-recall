<p>Gimme a V! Gimme a B! Gimme an A! What's that spell? VBA!</p><p><strong>Exercise: VBA Macros</strong></p><p><strong>Part 1</strong></p><p>Even if you skipped the <strong>"Excel 101" section of the course</strong>, take a moment to review the exercises at the end of that section. We're going to be automating most of these steps with a VBA macro!</p><p>After acquainting yourself with those steps, download and open the <strong>"Macros - Starter.xlsx" file</strong> that's at the bottom of this page.</p><p><strong>Part 2</strong></p><p>Within the <strong>"Macros - Starter.xlsx" file</strong>, record a macro (named "ProcessData") to capture the following actions:</p><ol><li><p>Delete the "ProductID" column in the data.</p></li><li><p>Unmerge the two cells composing the "CustomerName" column header, and then add "Customer First Name" and "Customer Last Name" headers for the two columns.</p></li><li><p>Cut the "Customer First Name" and "Customer Last Name" columns, and insert them to the left of the "ReviewStars" column.</p></li><li><p>Edit the remaining column headers to have spaces between the words in the names (i.e, "ProductName" becomes "Product Name").</p></li><li><p>Insert a new column, to the left of the other columns, and give it a column header of "Review Number".</p></li><li><p>Using Excel's autofill feature, populate this column with a series of numbers from one to the number of reviews in the dataset.</p></li><li><p>Re-format the "Purchase Date" and "Review Date" columns to the MM/DD/YYYY date format.</p></li><li><p>Re-format the "Review Stars" column to display zero digits after the decimal place.</p></li><li><p>Using Excel's find and replace feature, replace all instances of the word "ukelele" on the worksheet with "ukulele".</p></li><li><p>Change the font of all the cells in the range to "Segoe UI", size 10.</p></li><li><p>Give the column headers a dark background fill color from one of Excel's built-in "theme" colors - your choice!</p></li><li><p>Change the font color of the column headers to white.</p></li><li><p>Bold the column headers.</p></li><li><p>Auto-fit the widths of the columns to adjust to the width of the data they contain.</p></li><li><p>Freeze the top row of the data (the column headers) so that it remains visible no matter how far you scroll down through the data.</p></li><li><p>Finally, stop recording the macro.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Part 3</strong></p><p>Edit the macro code as follows:</p><ol><li><p>Fix any missteps you made while recording (if any), that Excel captured in the VBA code.</p></li><li><p>Remove any extraneous lines of VBA code the were generated by actions you don't need to capture.</p></li><li><p>Have the macro name the "Review Number" column "Review ID" instead.</p></li><li><p>Add a line of code at the beginning of the macro that suppresses alerts/warnings/dialog boxes for the duration of the macro.</p></li><li><p>Add a line of code at the end of the macro that causes a message box to appear after the macro completes, which says: "Congratulations, your macro ran successfully!".</p></li><li><p>Save the file as <strong>"Customer Reviews Template.xlsm" (note the macro-enabled file format)</strong>. This is now your <strong>template file.</strong></p></li></ol><p><strong>Part 4</strong></p><ol><li><p>Delete all the columns containing data on the worksheet.</p></li><li><p>Unfreeze panes in the worksheet.</p></li><li><p>Add a button to the worksheet, and assign it to your "ProcessData" macro.</p></li><li><p>Give the button a caption of "Execute Process".</p></li><li><p>Make sure the button is positioned far enough to the right to allow room for us to copy and paste in new data.</p></li><li><p>Save the <strong>template file </strong>(don't want to lose your changes!).</p></li></ol><p><strong>Part 5</strong></p><p>Time to put your <strong>template file</strong> to the test!</p><ol><li><p>Re-open the <strong>"Macros - Starter.xlsx" file</strong> in the resources section below.</p></li><li><p>Copy and paste the data from the <strong>"Macros - Starter.xlsx" file</strong> into cell A1 of our<strong> template file</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Click your "Execute Process" button, and hope for the best!</p></li><li><p>If anything goes awry, edit the macro code and see if you can diagnose the issue.</p></li></ol>
