<p>DATA. VISUALIZATION. You are visualizing the data, obviously. But think about what this means - it means you can take complex data and display it in a way that someone else (your boss, your friend, your partner) can understand at a glance. Pretty cool if you ask me!</p><p><strong>Exercise: Data Visualization in Excel</strong></p><ol><li><p>Download and open the <strong>"Data Visualization Exercise Starter.xlsx" file </strong>below.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Exercise 1</strong></p><ol><li><p>On the <strong>"Home Sale Data" worksheet</strong>, apply a conditional formatting rule to the "Acreage" column, such that homes with more than 20 acres are called out.

Name the column "SaleMonth".</p></li><li><p>Populate this column with a formula that returns the <strong>name </strong>of the month in which the home was sold. For example, if a home was sold on 8/6/2021, this column should have the value "August" for that row. <strong><em>HINT</em></strong><em>: The TEXT function, with a second argument of "mmmm", can help here.</em></p></li><li><p>On the <strong>"Exercise 3" worksheet</strong>, use the SUMIFS function to populate the three blank columns with each respective region's (West, Central, and North) sales for each month. <strong>HINT</strong>: You will need to apply multiple criteria in your SUMIFS functions.</p></li><li><p>Construct a column chart based on your completed data table.
