<p>Formulas are where the magic starts to happen, where you can really start doing some wizardry with data. Use this exercise to practice your formulas.</p><p><strong>Exercise: Excel Formulas 101</strong></p><ol><li><p>Download and open the <strong>"Excel Formulas - Starter.xlsx"</strong> file directly below (at the bottom of this page).</p></li><li><p>On the <strong>"Exercise 1" worksheet</strong>, insert a blank column to the left of the "Product Name" column, and give it the column header "Days Since Purchase".</p></li><li><p>Populate this new column with a formula that calculates the elapsed days between the purchase date and the review date. Make sure the results are formatted as numbers, with 0 digits after the decimal.</p></li><li><p>Add a new column to the right of "Customer Last Name", with the column header "Username".</p></li><li><p>Populate this column with a formula that automatically generates customer usernames as follows: it should concatenate the customer's first name, then a period/dot, then the customer's last name, in a single string.</p></li><li><p>On the "<strong>Exercise 2" worksheet</strong>, fill out the multiplication table by writing a single formula in the top left blank cell of the table, then copying that formula over the rest of the table. Each cell in the table should yield the result of multiplying the column header for that cell by its row header.</p></li><li><p>You will need to employ some combination of absolute and relative cell references in your formula to accomplish this. You can preview what the solution would look like (with no formulas of course!) on the "Multiplication Table Example" worksheet.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Solution</strong>: download the <strong>"Excel Formulas - Exercise Solution.xlsx"</strong> file to check your work.</p><p><br></p>
