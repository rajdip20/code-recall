<p>Here's where you get to model! No not a fashion model (although I've no doubt that you're a super good looking person!) but modeling <em>in Excel. </em>This is where the magic really happens!</p><p><strong>Exercise: Modeling in Excel</strong></p><p>The <strong>"Modeling in Excel - Exercise Starter.xlsx" file </strong>at the bottom of this page contains a basic model that calculates the future value of an investment (like a retirement plan) based on the following inputs:</p><ul><li><p>The current value of the investment (the input in cell B1)</p></li><li><p>The monthly payment/contribution to the investment (the input in cell B3)</p></li><li><p>The rate of return on the investment (the input in cell B5)</p></li><li><p>The time horizon of the investment (the input in cell B7)</p></li></ul><p>The model uses Excel's FV (future value) function in cell B9 to calculate the future value of the investment based on the above inputs. You don't need to understand exactly how the function works (although feel free to inspect it!); our focus in this exercise will be on varying the inputs to the final calculation in a dynamic and systematic way.</p><p>Try modifying the model in the starter file to resemble the screenshot below (and if you need it there are <strong>specific, step-by-step instructions</strong> right below the screenshot):</p><p><br></p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/article_lecture/2022-05-11_12-59-38-e0d0990b2a1011fac87bc7e4240ddc0f.png"></figure><p><br></p><ol><li><p>Set up a scroll bar to vary the monthly payment input between $0 and $10,000.</p></li><li><p>Set up a scroll bar to vary the rate of return input between 0% and 10%. Remember, rate of return will be a fractional number between 0 and 0.1, and the scroll bar can only handle whole numbers, so you may need to use a formula to translate the linked cell value into a percent.</p></li><li><p>Use a data validation list to give users of our model the following options for length of investment in years: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30.</p></li><li><p>Apply named ranges to all inputs in the model (as well as the range of values used for the data validation list).</p></li><li><p>Update the FV formula to reference these named ranges instead of cell references.</p></li><li><p>Use Excel's built-in cell styles to style the inputs/outputs/calculations of the model appropriately.</p></li><li><p>Apply any other formatting you deem appropriate to make the model more usable/readable.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Solution:</strong> see the <strong>"Modeling in Excel - Exercise Solution.xlsx" file</strong> below.</p>
