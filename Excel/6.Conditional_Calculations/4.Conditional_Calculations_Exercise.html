<p>This exercise is a two-parter. Double the fun (and double the skill-building)!</p><p><strong>Exercise: Conditional Calculations</strong></p><p><strong>Part 1:</strong></p><ol><li><p>Download and open the <strong>"Home Sale Data.xlsx" file</strong>, found in the resources for this section. Review the data on the <strong>"Home Sale Data" worksheet</strong>, which lists all the homes sold by a particular real estate agency in 2020.</p></li><li><p>Using the Ctrl + Shift + Down Arrow keyboard shortcut, select all the agent names from the "Agent" column, then copy and paste these names into cell A2 of the <strong>"Exercise 1" worksheet</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Using Excel's "Remove Duplicates" feature, transform this list of names into just the distinct/unique agent names (there should be 12).</p></li><li><p>Using Excel's SUMIFS function, calculate the total 2020 sales by each real estate agent in the "Total 2020 Sales" column on the <strong>"Exercise 1" worksheet</strong>.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Part 2:</strong></p><ol><li><p>Using the Ctrl + Shift + Down Arrow keyboard shortcut, select all the city names from the "City" column of the <strong>"Home Sale Data" worksheet</strong>, then copy and paste these cities into cell A2 of the "Exercise 2" worksheet.</p></li><li><p>Using Excel's "Remove Duplicates" feature, transform this list of cities into just the distinct/unique agent names (there should be 11).</p></li><li><p>In columns B through D of the <strong>"Exercise 2" worksheet</strong>, use Excel's COUNTIFS function to calculate the total sales for each city in 2020, per the sale price threshold specified in each column header. For example, in column B, you'll only want to count home sales for the given city in column A,<em> if the sale price was less than $500,000.</em> HINT: you will need to apply multiple criteria in your COUNTIFS functions to get this to work.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Solutions:</strong> see the Exercise Solutions file below.</p><p>Did you encounter any issues?
