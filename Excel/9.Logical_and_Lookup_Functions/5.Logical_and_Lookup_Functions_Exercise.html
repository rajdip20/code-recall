<p>Now we're cookin' with Logical and Lookup functions! If you need some inspiration, here's a quote to get you going: "It's what we do in the shadows, that puts us in the light".</p><p><strong>Exercises: Logical and Lookup Functions</strong></p><p>Open and download the <strong>"Logical and Lookup Functions - Exercises.xlsx" file </strong>below.</p><p><strong>Exercise 1</strong></p><p>In column G of the <strong>"Exercise 1" worksheet</strong>, write an IF formula that returns "Fail" if the actual shipping time in column F is greater than the order delivery goal in column D, and "Pass" otherwise.</p><p><strong>Exercise 2</strong></p><p>On the <strong>"Exercise 2" worksheet</strong>, add another layer to your IF formula from the previous exercise as follows:</p><ul><li><p>If the actual shipping time is <strong>equal </strong>to the order delivery goal, return "Meets".</p></li><li><p>If the actual shipping time is <strong>greater than </strong>the order delivery goal, return "Fail".</p></li><li><p>Otherwise (if the actual shipping time is <strong>less than </strong>the order delivery goal), return "Exceeds".</p></li></ul><p><em>Hint: Try using a nested IF function.</em></p><p><strong>Exercise 3</strong></p><p>In column G of the <strong>"Exercise 3" worksheet</strong>, calculate whether or not we need to provide a customer refund based on the following logic:</p><ul><li><p>If the order is a "rush" order (value of "Yes" in column C), AND the actual shipping time is <strong>greater than </strong>the order delivery goal, return "Yes".</p></li><li><p>Otherwise, return "No".</p></li></ul><p><em>Hint: Try nesting an "AND" function inside your IF function.</em></p><p><strong>Exercise 4</strong></p><p>For the customer names in column A of the <strong>"Exercise 4" worksheet</strong>, pull in the values for phone number, order date, order amount, and order quantity from the table on the <strong>"Customer Data" worksheet</strong>.</p><p>If no match can be found on the <strong>"Customer Data" worksheet</strong>, return a user-friendly message like "Not found".</p><p><strong>Exercise 5</strong></p><p>For the phone numbers in column A of the <strong>"Exercise 5" worksheet</strong>, pull in the values for customer name, order date, order amount, and order quantity from the table on the <strong>"Customer Data" worksheet</strong>.</p><p>If no match can be found on the <strong>"Customer Data" worksheet</strong>, return a user-friendly message like "Not found".</p><p><em>Hint: The columns on the </em><strong><em>"Customer Data" worksheet </em></strong><em>are NOT in the order needed to pull in customer name based on phone number. You'll need to reorder the columns (try using cut/insert) to get a VLOOKUP function to work for all the values. To keep your Exercise 4 formulas from breaking, I'd suggest making a copy of the "Customer Data" worksheet and then using the copied sheet for Exercise 5.</em></p><p><strong>Solutions: </strong>check the <strong>"Logical and Lookup Functions - Exercise Solutions" file</strong> below.
