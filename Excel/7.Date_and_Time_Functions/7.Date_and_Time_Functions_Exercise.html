<p>This exercise is actually SIX mini-exercises. But by the end of it you'll be a whiz with the DATE and TIME functions. Rock on!</p><p><strong>Exercises: Date &amp; Time Functions</strong></p><p>Open and download the <strong>"Date and Time Functions - Exercises.xlsx" file</strong> below. All these exercises are in worksheets within this file.</p><p><strong>Exercise 1</strong></p><p>In the <strong>"Exercise 1" worksheet</strong> of the exercise file, we have a list of product IDs, along with their date of purchase and the length of the product warranty in months. Using the DATE function (in conjunction with YEAR, MONTH, and DAY), calculate the expiration data of the warranty as an offset from the purchase date.</p><p><strong>Exercise 2</strong></p><p>In the <strong>"Exercise 2" worksheet</strong> of the exercise file, we have a list of customer order IDs, along with their respective order date/times and the number of hours the orders are required to be processed in (Fulfillment SLA). Using the TIME function (in conjunction with HOUR, MINUTE, and SECOND), calculate when the orders are due to be shipped as an offset from the order date/time.</p><p><strong>Exercise 3</strong></p><p>Our starter data for Exercise 3 is <em>almost </em>identical to that for exercise 2, with the exception that our order time now has a date component.</p><p>In column E, use "date math" to add the value in the "Fulfillment SLA" column to the "Order Datetime" value, to calculate when the orders are due to be shipped.</p><p><em>HINT: Excel looks at time values as simply fractions of a 24 hour day - for example, 12 hours is interpreted as 0.5, since it is half of a 24 hour day. As such, you'll need to divide the "Fulfillment SLA" by the appropriate number, and then add the result to the Order Datetime.</em></p><p><strong>Exercise 4</strong></p><p>For Exercise 4, calculate your age <strong>in months </strong>using Excel's DATEDIF function.</p><p><strong>Exercise 5</strong></p><p>In column F of the <strong>"Exercise 5" worksheet</strong>, use the NETWORKDAYS function to calculate the number of <strong>business days </strong>(that is to say, excluding weekends and holidays) elapsed between the Order Datetime in column B and the Delivery Date in column E. You can create a list of holidays observed in your country or place of business, to reference in your function, in the "Holidays" worksheet of the exercise file.</p><p><strong>Exercise 6</strong></p><p>In column C of the <strong>"Exercise 6" worksheet</strong>, remove the time component of the datetime values in column B using the TRUNC function.</p><p>Then, using the TEXT function, extract the weekday NAME (for example, "Monday") from the dates into column D.</p><p><strong>Solutions: </strong>check the Exercise Solutions file below to make sure you nailed it (I bet you did!).</p>
